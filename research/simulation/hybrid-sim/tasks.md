Hybrid Sim Project

Setup
- [x] FireSim Repo
- [x] FPGA Access - 9/12
- [x] Try FSim VCU118 example

Simple MVP
    - [x] Try w some stupid bridge
    - [x] Try MMIO + Boom setup - 9/25
    - [ ] Quantify
        - [ ] Average Delay?
        - [ ] Area

Prefetcher MVP
    - [ ] Figure out bar-fetchers
    - [ ] Profile bar-fetchers
    - [ ] Write SW models
    - [ ] Compare

Perf Model Bridge
    - [ ] Latency control
        - [ ] How to gate sim?
        - [ ] Gate sim?
        - [ ] RTL for ID + Delay Count + Insert Elem
            - [ ] Need some kind of priority queue/RoB 

Latency Minimization
    - [ ] Guess and Roll-back?
    - [ ] Profile perf models

Literature Review
    - [ ] Pongstorn Paper on controlled runahead
    - [ ] BYU SystemC Papers
    - [ ] HASim
    - [ ] FAME Papers

Maybe Try Sometime
- [ ] CY VCU118 example - is this even needed?
